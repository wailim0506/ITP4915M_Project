# Installation Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a WinForms application that uses a database and the Google Maps Static API. The setup process involves:

1. Configuring the application settings
2. Obtaining a Google Maps Static API key
3. Setting up a database (using either XAMPP or Docker)
4. Running the WinForms application

The database setup is a required step, and you must choose either Method 1 (XAMPP) or Method 2 (Docker) for this purpose.

The Database Cluster Setup is optional and can be implemented for more advanced configurations.
